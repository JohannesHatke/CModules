# Description
These are a couple of different basic data structures, that I have implementend in C99 with standard libraries. Currently there is an integer version of a single linked List and a generic version
# Todo:
- finish genericList
- add double linked genericList
- write Documentation
- implement basic Tree (maybe even RB-Tree)
